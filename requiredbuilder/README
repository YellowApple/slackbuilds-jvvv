RequiredBuilder is a simple tool to help Slackware packages developers
finding dependencies of a package and in particular writing the slack-required
file for the slapt-get's dependency checking.

It scans the package directory tree and finds all the binary dependencies 
using ldd. Besides it's able to identify scripts that need perl or python,
or classes that need java. After collecting dependencies it adds them to the
slack-required file using the informations in /var/log/packages.
Of course it doesn't substitute the package developer, in fact it won't
delete any handwritten dependency in the slack-required file.
