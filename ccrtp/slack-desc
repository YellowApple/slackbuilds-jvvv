# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

ccrtp: ccrtp (GNU implementation of RTP)
ccrtp:
ccrtp: ccRTP is a C++ framework for developing applications based on the
ccrtp: Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) from the IETF. It is based on
ccrtp: Common C++ and provides a full RTP/RTCP stack for sending and
ccrtp: receiving of realtime data using send and receive packet queues.
ccrtp: ccRTP supports unicast, multi-unicast and multicast, manages multiple
ccrtp: sources, handles RTCP automatically, supports different threading
ccrtp: models and is generic to underlying network and transport protocols.
