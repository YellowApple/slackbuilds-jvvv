ccrtp (GNU implementation of RTP)

ccRTP is a C++ framework for developing applications based on the
Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) from the IETF. It is based on
Common C++ and provides a full RTP/RTCP stack for sending and
receiving of realtime data using send and receive packet queues.
ccRTP supports unicast, multi-unicast and multicast, manages multiple
sources, handles RTCP automatically, supports different threading
models and is generic to underlying network and transport protocols.
