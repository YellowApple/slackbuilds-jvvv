# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xf86-input-wacom:
xf86-input-wacom: This package provides the X.Org X11 driver for Wacom and Wacom-like
xf86-input-wacom: tablets. It obsoletes the linuxwacom driver and supports X server
xf86-input-wacom: versions 1.7 and higher.
xf86-input-wacom: Since this driver is an X11 driver only, a kernel driver is required
xf86-input-wacom: to get hardware support. If the kernel driver is older than this
xf86-input-wacom: driver, some features may not be available.
