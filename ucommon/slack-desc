# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ucommon: ucommon (C++ Application Framework)
ucommon: GNU uCommon C++ is meant as a very light-weight C++ library to
ucommon: facilitate using C++ design patterns even for very deeply embedded
ucommon: applications, such as for systems using uclibc along with posix
ucommon: threading support.  For this reason, uCommon disables language
ucommon: features that consume memory or introduce runtime overhead, such
ucommon: as rtti and exception handling, and assumes one will mostly be
ucommon: linking applications with other pure C based libraries rather than
ucommon: using the overhead of the standard C++ library and other class
ucommon: frameworks.
