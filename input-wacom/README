README for input-wacom SlackBuild

The input-wacom driver is the usb kernel driver/module paired with
xf86-input-wacom. It backports new features and model support to kernels
as old as 2.6.30. You should not usually need to use this driver in most
circumstances, though it may be useful for recently-announced tablets or
older distributions.

At the time of writing, this module was tested with kernel 3.10.17.
Building requires the kernel source to be installed to /usr/src. The
SlackBuild script expects the symlink /usr/src/linux to point to the
version of the kernel that the module with run on. The specify a
different kernel location, use the environment variable KERNEL_TREE,
in this manner:

$ KERNEL_TREE=~/linux-3.10.25 ./SlackBuild.input-wacom

If you are using this module for a recently released tablet, then
you probably want/need an updated xf86-input-wacom package.

Also note that until you have tested that this module works for you,
it is recommended that you backup the current wacom module so that
it can be restored without re-installing the whole kernel:

# cp /lib/modules/3.10.17/kernel/drivers/input/tablet/wacom.ko{,.bak}
